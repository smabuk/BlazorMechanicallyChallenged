# BlazorMechanicallyChallenged

## What is Mechanically challenged?
Mechanically challenged is a monthly challenge in which we and the community
re-create different mechanics found in games! You are free to implement it in
any game engine or however you want, to join, fork this repository and upload
the mechanic! The goal is to create a repository of examples for these mechanics
in as many engines and languages as possible.

Each month a new mechanic will be explained and gifs of the mechanic will be
uploaded.
